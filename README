****  PITFALL : README  ****
****************************

Pitfall is a php class designed to allow you to easily conduct a product search using
Amazon.com's api and return the results in a easy-to-read (and, dare I say, keyute!)
associative array.

Using Pitfall is pretty straightforward and simple!


    $pit = new Pitfall(PUBLIC_KEY, PRIVATE_KEY, ASSOCIATE_ID);


Pitfall has one public method: search(). 


    array search ( array $terms [, string $searchIndex = "Books"]) 


search's $terms array needs to have a named key of either "Keywords", "Title", or "Author"
(note that capitalization's pretty important, otherwise you'll just get empty values).


    $pit->search(array("Keywords" => "moleskine year planner"));
    $pit->search(array("Author" => "Stephen King"));
    $pit->search(array("Title" => "the Dark Half"));


the searchIndex variable defines the area of searching. Pitfall is set-up to to best serve
searches within the "Books", "DVD", and "Music" indices.

============================================================================================

one other form of customization that Pitfall allows for is the specification of which values
to return for each item result. These _are_ case-sensitive, so be careful. Those followed by
(*) are the default values.
  


  Actor (returns an array)    NumberOfDiscs
  Artist                      Publisher (*)
  ASIN (*)                    Price (*)
  AudioFormat                 ProductGroup
  Author (*)                  ProductTypeName
  Binding (*)                 RegionCode
  Description (*)             ReleaseDate (*)
  DetailPageURL               RunningTime
  Director                    SmallImage (*)
  Edition                     Studio
  Genre                       Title (*)
  ISBN (*)                    UPC
  LargeImage
  MediumImage(*)

  (note! Binding doubles as Format for DVD/Music searches)



changing which fields are returned is as easy as creating a new array using the above values 
and changing the public fields variable before searching:


    $pit->fields = array("Title", "Actor", "Director", "Binding", RunningTime");
    $pit->search(array("Keywords" => "the fast and the furious"));


happy trails!
